                            </br>Many commands that are executed produce text output like this. You can change what output is produced by a command by using options after the name of the command. Options for a command can be specified in several ways. Traditionally in UNIX, options were expressed by a hyphen followed by another character, for example: <code>-n</code>.
                            </br>In Linux, options can sometimes also be given by two hyphen characters followed by a word, or hyphenated word, for example: <code>--nodename</code>.</p>

                        <p>The <code>pwd</code> command is used to display your current "location" or current "working" directory.
                            </br>The current directory in the example below is <code class="console">/home/sysadmin</code>. This is also referred to as your home directory, a special place where you have control of files and other users normally have no access.
                            </br>By default, this directory is named the same as your username and is located underneath the <code class="console">/home</code> directory.</p>

                        <p>The PATH variable is displayed by placing a <code>$</code> character in front of the name of the variable. This variable is used to find the location of commands. </br>Each of the directories listed below are searched when you run a command. </br>If you try to run the <code>date</code> command, the shell will first look for the command in the <code class="console">/home/sysadmin/bin</code> directory and then in the <code class="console">/usr/local/sbin</code> directory and so on.
